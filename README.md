# JCRL #
---

JCRL is a library of fundamental algorithms and data structures written in C. JCRL is designed as a purely educational resource and should not be used for production. 

Currently, JCRL implements:

 - linked lists
  - single
  - double
 - stacks
 - queues
 - bubblesort
 - sets

Obviously, many more are on the way.
